# Anime Downloader

Just a Samll python script to download my favorite anime from http servers. 
Just search for "index of <any anime>" on google and copy the base URL. 
Pase that in the config.yaml file under "animeBaseUrl". Give an appropriate path on the pc under "animeDir"
and run the download.py script. 
  
```
python3 download.py
```
